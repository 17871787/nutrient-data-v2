# Problem Statement

## The Hidden Value Crisis in Agriculture

### ðŸ”´ The Problem
UK farms are sitting on **Â£8,000-15,000 of nutrient value** in their slurry stores, yet most farmers:
- Don't know this value exists
- Buy expensive synthetic fertilizers anyway (Â£800-1,500/tonne)
- Risk NVZ compliance penalties (up to Â£250,000)
- Lose 20-40% of nutrients through poor timing and application

### ðŸ“Š The Numbers
- **Â£10,500** - Average value of nutrients in a 4,000mÂ³ slurry store
- **170 kg N/ha** - Legal limit that 30% of farms accidentally exceed
- **Â£3,500/year** - Typical unnecessary fertilizer spend
- **25-30%** - Nitrogen lost to atmosphere from poor application

### ðŸš« Why Current Tools Fail
1. **Spreadsheets** - Too complex, no visualization, easy to break
2. **Farm Software** - Expensive, over-engineered, poor nutrient focus
3. **Consultant Models** - Locked away, no farmer access, outdated
4. **Paper Records** - Can't calculate value or check compliance

### ðŸ’¡ The Insight
Farmers make better decisions when they see the **monetary value** of nutrients, not just the kg amounts. By connecting slurry nutrients to fertilizer prices, we transform an abstract compliance exercise into a tangible business opportunity.

### âœ… What's Needed
A tool that:
- Shows nutrient value in Â£ instantly
- Takes <5 minutes to enter data
- Checks compliance automatically
- Works on any device
- Costs nothing to use

**This is why we built the Nutrient Budget Tool.**
